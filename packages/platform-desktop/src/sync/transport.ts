// Device sync: enrollment and the live roster session.

// The host runs in THIS webview rather than a separate one. The extension needs an offscreen
// document because MV3's service worker has no DOM; mobile has one webview and so does the
// desktop, so @core's transport, relay client and merge engine run in-process. macOS WKWebView
// exposes RTCPeerConnection, RTCDataChannel and WebSocket, which is what makes that possible
// without a native bridge. See docs/desktop-port.md.
//
// The crypto still comes from the Rust side (`desktopSyncCrypto`), because the VEK lives there
// and never crosses into the webview. That is the only structural difference from mobile.
