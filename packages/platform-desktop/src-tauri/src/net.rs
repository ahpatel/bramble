//! Outbound HTTP on behalf of the webview, which cannot make these requests itself.
//!
//! `tauri://localhost` is granted CORS by nothing: not an S3 endpoint, not a WebDAV server, and
//! not an API that sends no CORS headers at all. So a request to a third party is sent from here,
//! where there is no origin to refuse and no browser to enforce one.
//!
//! Every request this process makes goes through `send`, so the two rules hold once rather than
//! per caller. Both are the same ones `@core/adapters/http` documents for the JS side:
//!
//! - **No ambient cookies.** The credential is the header the caller set and nothing else. The
//!   `cookies` feature is deliberately absent from the reqwest dependency, so there is no cookie
//!   store to accidentally enable. An open browser session for the same host has already
//!   outranked an Authorization header here once (1255ab7b).
//! - **No redirect following.** A redirect out of an API call means the session was rejected and
//!   the destination is an HTML login page; for a signed request it also moves the request off
//!   the URL that was signed. A 3xx is returned as itself.
//!
//! See docs/email-aliases.md and docs/cloud-storage-backups.md.
