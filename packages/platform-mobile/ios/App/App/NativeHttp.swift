/**
 * Outbound HTTP for hosts the WKWebView cannot reach.
 *
 * The WebView's origin is `capacitor://localhost`, which an API that sends no CORS headers grants
 * nothing, so requests to those hosts leave from here instead. The `jsName` matches Android's
 * plugin so one shared adapter drives both. See @core/adapters/http.
 *
 * Two rules, and `CapacitorHttp` keeps neither, which is why this exists rather than using it:
 * its `HttpRequestHandler` calls `setCookiesFromResponse` on every reply, parsing the host's
 * `Set-Cookie` into the Capacitor cookie manager and syncing it into the WebView, and outbound
 * the `URLRequest` default of `httpShouldHandleCookies = true` attaches whatever is in shared
 * storage. An ambient session outranking an Authorization header has already cost this repo a
 * day once (1255ab7b).
 *
 * So: an ephemeral session that accepts no cookies and a delegate that refuses redirects. A
 * redirect out of an API call means the session was rejected and the destination is an HTML
 * login page, so the 3xx is returned as itself and the caller can say "bad key" rather than
 * failing opaquely somewhere else.
