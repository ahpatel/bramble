/**
 * The native transport on a device, plain `fetch` in the dev browser.
 *
 * A platform guard rather than a try/catch, because a transport that quietly degrades is worse
 * than one that fails: falling back to `fetch` on a device would put the request back inside the
 * WebView, where the CORS-less hosts this exists for cannot be reached and the cookie rules do
 * not hold. `pnpm dev` has no native plugin and also no CORS problem, so there the fallback is
 * both necessary and correct.
 *
 * Decided per call, not at module load: `isNativePlatform()` reads the injected bridge and
 * answers "web" until it is there, so freezing it here could bake in the wrong answer for the
 * life of the process (the same trap `adapters/biometric` documents for `getPlatform`).
