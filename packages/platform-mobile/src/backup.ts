// Opportunistic cloud backups on mobile.
//
// There is no background scheduler on iOS or Android, so a wall-clock promise cannot be kept
// here: the only moments this process is reliably alive and able to decrypt are an unlock and a
// resume, and those are what this listens to. The desktop keeps a real schedule because it is
// tray-resident with credentials in the OS store; mobile has neither, so the setting means "next
// time you open Bramble after this long" rather than "at this time".
//
// Everything below is platform I/O. The due decision and the orchestration are the pure, tested
// runScheduledBackups/isDue in @core, the same ones the extension and the desktop drive.
// See docs/cloud-storage-backups.md.
