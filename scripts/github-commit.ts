// Commit and tag through GitHub's API rather than `git push`, for release jobs on a runner.

// Two reasons, both about a runner having no key of its own. A commit made with
// `createCommitOnBranch` is signed by GitHub and shows as verified, where a runner's `git commit`
// would be unsigned; and it lands only if the branch still points where it was told to
// (`expectedHeadOid`), so a release can never be committed on top of something it did not build.
// The one exception is other releases' version bumps, which touch nothing it built: see
// commitOverReleases.
//
// Needs GH_TOKEN with contents: write. See docs/ci-releases.md.

/**
 * Why a release cannot be committed over what landed on the branch since its build, or null when
 * it can.
 *
 * Releases are dispatched together and approved whenever someone gets to them, so another target's
 * version bump landing mid-build is the normal case, and refusing it made the order of approvals
 * matter. It can be committed over only when it is provably inert for this release: every commit
 * is a release commit, every file it touched is release metadata (each target's version, the
 * desktop update manifest), and none is a file this release writes, which it would otherwise
 * overwrite from a stale copy. The tree tagged is then what was built plus other targets' version
 * numbers. Anything else, a code change above all, still refuses.
